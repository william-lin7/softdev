1) I think clicking on any of the names in the table will cause an alert
   to pop up that shows the name as the alert message because each name is
   associated with an event listener that triggers the clicky function.
   This was a correct observation.


2) This is pretty much the same as the first demo, except it includes more
   features that send alerts when clicking the table too. When a user clicks
   on a cell, the names would probably pop up in the order that they were
   typed in. I'm not sure what clicking on the table will print. Upon further
   observation, clicking on the table results in an alert message that shows
   the html-formatted body of the table.

3) Builds off of question 2. When the stopPropagation function is uncommented,
   it would probably stop the table front showing an alert message. Upon
   observation, I was wrong. The function actually prevents the individual
   name from being alerted, but still shows the alert message of the table.

4) The order does matter because whichever comes first is run first. But I
   turned out to be wrong, because it was actually in the reverse order.
   The events ran from bottom to top.
